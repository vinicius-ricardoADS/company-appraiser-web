# Company Appraiser Web

This project consists of building a front-end system for evaluating products from companies that are still in production. For more information about its use and how it was made, the link to the back-end system repository is below [Back-end](https://github.com/vinicius-ricardoADS/company-appraiser-server). In this project, every concern with user interaction and responsiveness was taken more into account, trying to bring familiarity to system users with ways to login, register, recover password and ways to download the discount coupon given after the evaluation of a product.
